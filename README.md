# video-face-detection

Figure out how to stream a local IP camera through a proxy (to avoid CORS/security) issues, 
and serve a static web site from the same localhost:port, so it can be displayed in a web page
and subjected to manipulation by JavaScript -- specifically, for face detection using trackingjs.
